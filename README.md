Prompts added

I have some Java code that is there in @Folder D:\VDrive\GAVS\Platform Engg\Java2Python\AI-Java-Upgrade-StreamingProj-master to be converted to convert into Python. 
Create the output to a working directory under python_conversion. 
The Python version should be the latest and Pandas to be used for extensive data handling instead of raw loops/collections
Please explain what the code is doing first, before converting
The code should be made highly secure and follows OWASP security guidelines
Convert the above Java code into Python. Use Pandas where appropriate instead of Java collections like ArrayList, HashMap, or loops
Optimize the Python code to use idiomatic Pandas features, such as DataFrame.apply(), groupby(), merge(), or vectorized operations, instead of Python loops
Write a short example input dataset and show the expected output for both the Java version (conceptually) and the new Pandas version, so I can confirm correctness
Can you suggest how to handle missing values, large datasets, or performance issues in the Pandas version?
Generate Python unit tests (using pytest) to validate the correctness of the Pandas-based implementation.
